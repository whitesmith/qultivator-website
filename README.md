Qultivator is a project built under 32h for the Whitesmith Hackathon (July 2016).
It is a IoT project that allows plants to be individually monitored and taken cared of in real-time.
Several environmental data can be gathered using sensors, and both a light and irrigation system can be controlled in real-time using the Qultivator website.
